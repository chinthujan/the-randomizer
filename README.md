# The Randomizer
This is a web page application that was created with the intention of having multiple styles of randomizers in one location (all of which will be created via HTML, CSS, and JavaScript).
## Current Randomizers
- Random choice selector (from a user-defined list)
>Currently working on this and am aiming to have a functional CSS animation to select the randomized word/option
## Roadmap (Coming soon)
- Random number generator
- Random word generator
